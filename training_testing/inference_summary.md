# Video-Guard LoRA Training and Inference Summary

## Training Status ✅

The Video-Guard LoRA model has been successfully trained with the following details:

### Training Configuration
- **Base Model**: OpenGVLab/InternVL3-8B
- **Training Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Dataset**: Full dataset with streaming video data
- **Training Steps**: 990 steps completed
- **Checkpoint Location**: `/scratch/czr/Video-Guard/training_testing/output_full_lora_streaming/checkpoint-990/`

### Training Results
- ✅ Model successfully loaded and trained
- ✅ LoRA weights generated and saved
- ✅ Training completed without errors
- ✅ Checkpoint files created:
  - `adapter_model.safetensors` (80MB)
  - `adapter_config.json`
  - `training_state.pt` (161MB)
  - Tokenizer files

## Inference Challenges ⚠️

### Current Status
The trained model has been successfully loaded, but inference requires additional setup due to the complex image processing requirements of InternVL3-8B.

### Issues Encountered
1. **Image Processing**: The model expects specific image tensor formats
2. **Token Initialization**: Requires proper setup of image context tokens
3. **Model Architecture**: InternVL3-8B has complex vision-language integration

### Next Steps for Inference
To properly test the trained model, you would need to:

1. **Use the model's built-in chat interface** with proper image preprocessing
2. **Implement the correct data collator** from the training script
3. **Handle the streaming video format** as used during training
4. **Set up proper image token replacement** for the MJ-Video style input
